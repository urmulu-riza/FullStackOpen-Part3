```bash
npm install
```

without arguments installs all dependencies (and dev dependencies) listed in the package.json file.

```bash
npm install --production
```

installs all the dependencies (but no dev dependency)

```bash
npm install  <package>
```

installs a package and its dependencies.

```bash
npm install <package> --save
```

installs a package and its dependencies, and adds it in the package.json file.

Edit: Since npm 5, --save is implied.

## 3.a node.js and express

We will be building our backend on top of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is a JavaScript runtime based on Google's [Chrome V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) JavaScript engine.

version <i>v18.13.0</i> of Node.js. ( check _node -v_ in the command line).

The newest version of Node supports a large majority of the latest features of JavaScript, so we can use the latest features without having to transpile our code.

[npm](/en/part2/getting_data_from_server#npm), a tool used for managing JavaScript packages, originates from the Node ecosystem.

Let's navigate to an appropriate directory, and create a new template for our application with the _npm init_ command. <i>package.json</i> file at the root of the project contains information about the project.

```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Matti Luukkainen",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

The file defines the entry point of the application as the <i>index.js</i> file.

```bash
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js", // highlight-line
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  // ...
}
```

We can run programs directly with Node from the command line Or we can run it as an [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)::

```bash
node index.js
//or
npm start
```

By default, the <i>package.json</i> file also defines another commonly used npm script called <i>npm test</i>. Since our project does not yet have a testing library, the _npm test_ command simply executes the following command:

```bash
echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1
```

### Simple web server

Let's change the application into a web server:

```js
const http = require('http');

const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.end('Hello World');
});

const PORT = 3001;
app.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
```

We can open our humble application in the browser by visiting the address <http://localhost:3001>:

The server works the same way regardless of the latter part of the URL. Also the address <http://localhost:3001/foo/bar> will display the same content.

In the first row, the application imports Node's built-in [web server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html) module. This is practically what we have already been doing in our browser-side code, but with a slightly different syntax:

```js
import http from 'http';
```

These days, code that runs in the browser uses ES6 modules. Modules are defined with an [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) and taken into use with an [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

However, Node.js uses so-called [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) modules. The reason for this is that the Node ecosystem had a need for modules long before JavaScript supported them in the language specification. Node supports now also the use of ES6 modules, but since the support is yet [not quite perfect](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) we'll stick to CommonJS modules.

CommonJS modules function almost exactly like ES6 modules.

```js
const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.end('Hello World');
});
```

The code uses the _createServer_ method of the [http](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html) module to create a new web server. An <i>event handler</i> is registered to the server that is called <i>every time</i> an HTTP request is made to the server's address <http://localhost:3001>.

The request is responded to with the status code 200, with the <i>Content-Type</i> header set to <i>text/plain</i>, and the content of the site to be returned set to <i>Hello World</i>.

The last rows bind the http server assigned to the _app_ variable, to listen to HTTP requests sent to port 3001:

```js
const PORT = 3001;
app.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
```

The primary purpose of the backend server in this course is to offer raw data in JSON format to the frontend. For this reason, let's immediately change our server to return a hardcoded list of notes in the JSON format:

```js
const http = require('http');

// highlight-start
let notes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: 'HTML is easy',
    important: true,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: 'Browser can execute only JavaScript',
    important: false,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    content: 'GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol',
    important: true,
  },
];

const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
  response.end(JSON.stringify(notes));
});
// highlight-end

const PORT = 3001;
app.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
```

The <i>application/json</i> value in the <i>Content-Type</i> header informs the receiver that the data is in the JSON format. The _notes_ array gets transformed into JSON with the <em>JSON.stringify(notes)</em> method.

### Express

Implementing our server code directly with Node's built-in [http](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html) web server is possible, but cumbersome.

Many libraries have been developed to ease server-side development with Node, by offering a more pleasing interface to work with the built-in http module. By far the most popular library intended for this purpose is [express](http://expressjs.com).

Let's take express into use by defining it as a project dependency with the command:

```bash
npm install express
```

The dependency is also added to our <i>package.json</i> file:

```json
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The source code for the dependency is installed in the <i>node_modules</i> directory located at the root of the project. In addition to express, you can find a great number of other dependencies in the directory.

These are the dependencies of the express library and the dependencies of all of its dependencies, and so forth. These are called the [transitive dependencies](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/) of our project.

The version 4.18.2 of express was installed in our project. What does the caret in front of the version number in <i>package.json</i> mean?

```json
"express": "^4.18.2"
```

The versioning model used in npm is called [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning).

The caret in the front of <i>^4.18.2</i> means that if and when the dependencies of a project are updated, the version of express that is installed will be at least <i>4.18.2</i>. However, the installed version of express can also have a larger <i>patch</i> number (the last number), or a larger <i>minor</i> number (the middle number). The major version of the library indicated by the first <i>major</i> number must be the same.

We can update the dependencies of the project with the command:

```bash
npm update
```

Likewise, if we start working on the project on another computer, we can install all up-to-date dependencies of the project defined in <i>package.json</i> by running this next command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

If the <i>major</i> number of a dependency does not change, then the newer versions should be [backwards compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility). This means that if our application happened to use version 4.99.175 of express in the future, then all the code implemented in this part would still have to work without making changes to the code. In contrast, the future 5.0.0 version of express [may contain](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html) changes that would cause our application to no longer work.

### Web and express

Let's get back to our application and make the following changes:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

let notes = [
  ...
]

app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>')
})

app.get('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
  response.json(notes)
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

1st row: imports _express_, which this time is a <i>function</i> that is used to create an express application stored in the _app_ variable:

Next: two <i>routes</i> defined to the application. The first one defines an event handler that is used to handle HTTP GET requests made to the application's <i>/</i> root:

```js
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>');
});
```

The event handler function accepts two parameters. The first [request](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) parameter contains all of the information of the HTTP request, and the second [response](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) parameter is used to define how the request is responded to.

In our code, the request is answered by using the [send](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.send) method of the _response_ object. Calling the method makes the server respond to the HTTP request by sending a response containing the string <code>\<h1>Hello World!\</h1></code> that was passed to the _send_ method. Since the parameter is a string, express automatically sets the value of the <i>Content-Type</i> header to be <i>text/html</i>. The status code of the response defaults to 200.

We can verify this from the <i>Network</i> tab in developer tools.

The second route defines an event handler that handles HTTP GET requests made to the <i>notes</i> path of the application:

The request is responded to with the [json](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json) method of the _response_ object. Calling the method will send the **notes** array that was passed to it as a JSON formatted string. Express automatically sets the <i>Content-Type</i> header with the appropriate value of <i>application/json</i>.

In the earlier version where we were only using Node, we had to transform the data into the JSON format with the _JSON.stringify_ method:

```js
response.end(JSON.stringify(notes));
```

With express, this is no longer required, because this transformation happens automatically.

It's worth noting that [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a string and not a JavaScript object like the value assigned to _notes_.

interactive [node-repl](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/repl.html). You can start the interactive node-repl by typing in _node_ in the command line. The repl is particularly useful for testing how commands work while you're writing application code. I highly recommend this!

### nodemon

If we make changes to the application's code we have to restart the application to see the changes. We restart the application by first shutting it down by typing _Ctrl+C_ and then restarting the application. Compared to the convenient workflow in React where the browser automatically reloaded after changes were made, this feels slightly cumbersome.

The solution to this problem is [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon):

> <i>nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.</i>

Let's install nodemon by defining it as a <i>development dependency</i> with the command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

The contents of <i>package.json</i> have also changed:

```json
{
  //...
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
  }
}
```

By development dependencies, we are referring to tools that are needed only during the development of the application, e.g. for testing or automatically restarting the application, like <i>nodemon</i>.

These development dependencies are not needed when the application is run in production mode on the production server (e.g. Fly.io or Heroku).

We can start our application with <i>nodemon</i> like this:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js
```

Changes to the application code now cause the server to restart automatically, but the browser still has to be manually refreshed. Unlike React, we don't have the [hot reload](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/) functionality needed to automatically reload the browser.

```bash
{
  // ..
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",  // highlight-line
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  // ..
}
```

We can now start the server in development mode with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Unlike with the <i>start</i> and <i>test</i> scripts, we also have to add <i>run</i> to the command because it is a non-native script.

### REST

Representational State Transfer, aka REST, was introduced in 2000 in Roy Fielding's [dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm). REST is an architectural style meant for building scalable web applications.

We are not going to dig into Fielding's definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn't RESTful. Instead, we take a more [narrow view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services) by only concerning ourselves with how RESTful APIs are typically understood in web applications. The original definition of REST is not even limited to web applications.

We mentioned in the [previous part](/en/part2/altering_data_in_server#rest) that singular things, like notes in the case of our application, are called <i>resources</i> in RESTful thinking. Every resource has an associated URL which is the resource's unique address.

One convention for creating unique addresses is to combine the name of the resource type with the resource's unique identifier.

Let's assume that the root URL of our service is <i>www.example.com/api</i>.

If we define the resource type of note to be <i>notes</i>, then the address of a note resource with the identifier 10, has the unique address <i>www.example.com/api/notes/10</i>.

The URL for the entire collection of all note resources is <i>www.example.com/api/notes</i>.

We can execute different operations on resources. The operation to be executed is defined by the HTTP <i>verb</i>:

| URL      | verb   | functionality                                                    |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| notes/10 | GET    | fetches a single resource                                        |
| notes    | GET    | fetches all resources in the collection                          |
| notes    | POST   | creates a new resource based on the request data                 |
| notes/10 | DELETE | removes the identified resource                                  |
| notes/10 | PUT    | replaces the entire identified resource with the request data    |
| notes/10 | PATCH  | replaces a part of the identified resource with the request data |
|          |        |                                                                  |

This is how we manage to roughly define what REST refers to as a [uniform interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints), which means a consistent way of defining interfaces that makes it possible for systems to cooperate.

This way of interpreting REST falls under the [second level of RESTful maturity](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) in the Richardson Maturity Model. According to the definition provided by Roy Fielding, we have not defined a [REST API](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven). In fact, a large majority of the world's purported "REST" APIs do not meet Fielding's original criteria outlined in his dissertation.

In some places (see e.g. [Richardson, Ruby: RESTful Web Services](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529260.do)) you will see our model for a straightforward [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) API, being referred to as an example of [resource-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture) instead of REST. We will avoid getting stuck arguing semantics and instead return to working on our application.

### Fetching a single resource

Let's expand our application so that it offers a REST interface for operating on individual notes. First, let's create a [route](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) for fetching a single resource.

The unique address we will use for an individual note is of the form <i>notes/10</i>, where the number at the end refers to the note's unique id number.

We can define [parameters](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters) for routes in express by using the colon syntax:

```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id); // highlight-line
  const note = notes.find((note) => note.id === id);
  response.json(note);
});
```

Now <code>app.get('/api/notes/:id', ...)</code> will handle all HTTP GET requests that are of the form <i>/api/notes/SOMETHING</i>, where <i>SOMETHING</i> is an arbitrary string, **_and NOT A NUMBER_**.

The <i>id</i> parameter in the route of a request can be accessed through the [request](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) object:

```js
const id = request.params.id;
```

The _request.params.id_ returns a string '1', whereas the ids of notes are integers. In JavaScript, the "triple equals" comparison === considers all values of different types to not be equal by default, meaning that 1 is not '1'.

Now fetching an individual resource works. However, there's another problem with our application.

If we search for a note with an id that does not exist, the server responds with status code 200.

The HTTP status code that is returned is 200, which means that the response succeeded. There is no data sent back with the response, since the value of the <i>content-length</i> header is 0, and the same can be verified from the browser.

The reason for this behavior is that the _note_ variable is set to _undefined_ if no matching note is found. The situation needs to be handled on the server in a better way. If no note is found, the server should respond with the status code [404 not found](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-404-not-found) instead of 200.

Let's make the following change to our code:

```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id);
  const note = notes.find((note) => note.id === id);

  // highlight-start
  if (note) {
    response.json(note);
  } else {
    response.status(404).end();
  }
  // highlight-end
});
```

Since no data is attached to the response, we use the [status](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.status) method for setting the status and the [end](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.end) method for responding to the request without sending any data.

The if-condition leverages the fact that all JavaScript objects are [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy), meaning that they evaluate to true in a comparison operation. However, _undefined_ is [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) meaning that it will evaluate to false.

Our application works and sends the error status code if no note is found. However, the application doesn't return anything to show to the user, like web applications normally do when we visit a page that does not exist. We do not need to display anything in the browser because REST APIs are interfaces that are intended for programmatic use, and the error status code is all that is needed.

Anyway, it's possible to give a clue about the reason for sending a 404 error by [overriding the default NOT FOUND message](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14154337/how-to-send-a-custom-http-status-message-in-node-express/36507614#36507614).

### Deleting resources

Next, let's implement a route for deleting resources. Deletion happens by making an HTTP DELETE request to the URL of the resource:

```js
app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id);
  notes = notes.filter((note) => note.id !== id);

  response.status(204).end();
});
```

If deleting the resource is successful, meaning that the note exists and is removed, we respond to the request with the status code [204 no content](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-204-no-content) and return no data with the response.

There's no consensus on what status code should be returned to a DELETE request if the resource does not exist. The only two options are 204 and 404. For the sake of simplicity, our application will respond with 204 in both cases.

### Postman

So how do we test the delete operation? We could write some JavaScript for testing deletion, but writing test code is not always the best solution in every situation.

Many tools exist for making the testing of backends easier. One of these is a command line program [curl](https://curl.haxx.se). However, instead of curl, we will take a look at using [Postman](https://www.postman.com) for testing the application.

### The Visual Studio Code REST client

VS Code [REST client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) plugin does the same task as Postman.

Once the plugin is installed, make a directory at the root of the application named <i>requests</i>. Save all the REST client requests in the directory as files that end with the <i>.rest</i> extension.

Let's create a new <i>get_all_notes.rest</i> file and define the request that fetches all notes. By clicking the <i>Send Request</i> text, the REST client will execute the HTTP request and the response from the server is opened in the editor.

### The WebStorm HTTP Client

If you use _IntelliJ WebStorm_ instead. Read [this guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html).

### Receiving data

Adding a note happens by making an HTTP POST request to the address <http://localhost:3001/api/notes>, and by sending all the information for the new note in the request [body](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7) in JSON format.

To access the data easily, we need the help of the express [json-parser](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) that is taken to use with command _app.use(express.json())_.

```js
const generateId = () => {
  const maxId = notes.length > 0 ? Math.max(...notes.map((n) => n.id)) : 0;
  return maxId + 1;
};

app.post('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
  const body = request.body;

  if (!body.content) {
    return response.status(400).json({
      error: 'content missing',
    });
  }

  const note = {
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important || false,
    id: generateId(),
  };

  notes = notes.concat(note);

  response.json(note);
});
```

With out defining the _note_ variable, if we use <code>const note = request.body;</code> The current version still has the problem that the HTTP POST request can be used to add objects with arbitrary properties.

If the received data is missing a value for the <i>content</i> property, the server will respond to the request with the status code [400 bad request](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-400-bad-request):

Notice that calling return is crucial because otherwise the code will execute to the very end and the malformed note gets saved to the application.

The event handler function can access the data from the <i>body</i> property of the _request_ object.

Without the json-parser, the <i>body</i> property would be undefined. The json-parser functions so that it takes the JSON data of a request, transforms it into a JavaScript object and then attaches it to the <i>body</i> property of the _request_ object before the route handler is called.

A potential cause for issues is an incorrectly set <i>Content-Type</i> header in requests. This can happen with Postman if the type of body is not defined correctly.

In portman when <i>Content-Type</i> header is set to <i>text/plain</i>, The server appears to only receive an empty object. The server will not be able to parse the data correctly without the correct value in the header. It won't even try to guess the format of the data since there's a [massive amount](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of potential <i>Content-Types</i>.

One benefit that the REST client has over Postman is that the requests are handily available at the root of the project repository, and they can be distributed to everyone in the development team. You can also add multiple requests in the same file using `###` separators:

```text
GET http://localhost:3001/api/notes/

###
POST http://localhost:3001/api/notes/ HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}
```

Postman also allows users to save requests, but the situation can get quite chaotic especially when you're working on multiple unrelated projects.

> **Important sidenote**
>
> Sometimes when you're debugging, you may want to find out what headers have been set in the HTTP request. One way of accomplishing this is through the [get](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.get) method of the _request_ object, that can be used for getting the value of a single header. The _request_ object also has the <i>headers</i> property, that contains all of the headers of a specific request.
>
> Problems can occur with the VS REST client if you accidentally add an empty line between the top row and the row specifying the HTTP headers. In this situation, the REST client interprets this to mean that all headers are left empty, which leads to the backend server not knowing that the data it has received is in the JSON format.
>
> You will be able to spot this missing <i>Content-Type</i> header if at some point in your code you print all of the request headers with the _console.log(request.headers)_ command.

### About HTTP request types

[The HTTP standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-common-method-properties) talks about two properties related to request types, **safety** and **idempotency**.

The HTTP GET request should be <i>safe</i>:

> <i>In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe".</i>

Safety means that the executing request must not cause any <i>side effects</i> on the server. By side effects, we mean that the state of the database must not change as a result of the request, and the response must only return data that already exists on the server.

Nothing can ever guarantee that a GET request is <i>safe</i>, this is just a recommendation that is defined in the HTTP standard. By adhering to RESTful principles in our API, GET requests are always used in a way that they are <i>safe</i>.

The HTTP standard also defines the request type [HEAD](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-head), which ought to be safe. In practice, HEAD should work exactly like GET but it does not return anything but the status code and response headers. The response body will not be returned when you make a HEAD request.

All HTTP requests except POST should be <i>idempotent</i>:

> <i>Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property</i>

This means that if a request does not generate side effects, then the result should be the same regardless of how many times the request is sent.

If we make an HTTP PUT request to the URL <i>/api/notes/10</i> and with the request we send the data <em>{ content: "no side effects!", important: true }</em>, the result is the same regardless of how many times the request is sent.

Like <i>safety</i> for the GET request, <i>idempotence</i> is also just a recommendation in the HTTP standard and not something that can be guaranteed simply based on the request type. However, when our API adheres to RESTful principles, then GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE requests are used in such a way that they are idempotent.

POST is the only HTTP request type that is neither <i>safe</i> nor <i>idempotent</i>. If we send 5 different HTTP POST requests to <i>/api/notes</i> with a body of <em>{content: "many same", important: true}</em>, the resulting 5 notes on the server will all have the same content.

### Middleware

The express [json-parser](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) we took into use earlier is a so-called [middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html).

Middleware are functions that can be used for handling _request_ and _response_ objects.

The json-parser we used earlier takes the raw data from the requests that are stored in the _request_ object, parses it into a JavaScript object and assigns it to the _request_ object as a new property <i>body</i>.

In practice, you can use several middlewares at the same time. When you have more than one, they're executed one by one in the order that they were taken into use in express.

Let's implement our own middleware that prints information about every request that is sent to the server.

Middleware is a function that receives three parameters:

```js
const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  console.log('Method:', request.method);
  console.log('Path:  ', request.path);
  console.log('Body:  ', request.body);
  console.log('---');
  next();
};
```

At the end of the function body, the _next_ function that was passed as a parameter is called. The _next_ function yields control to the next middleware.

Middleware is taken into use like this:

```js
app.use(requestLogger);
```

Middleware functions are called in the order that they're taken into use with the express server object's _use_ method. Notice that json-parser is taken into use before the _requestLogger_ middleware, because otherwise <i>request.body</i> will not be initialized when the logger is executed!

Middleware functions have to be taken into use before routes if we want them to be executed before the route event handlers are called. There are also situations where we want to define middleware functions after routes. In practice, this means that we are defining middleware functions that are only called if no route handles the HTTP request.

Let's add the following middleware after our routes. This middleware will be used for catching requests made to non-existent routes. For these requests, the middleware will return an error message in the JSON format.

```js
const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' });
};

app.use(unknownEndpoint);
```
