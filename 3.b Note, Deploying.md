## Deploying app to internet

Next, let's connect the frontend we made in [part 2](/en/part2) to our own backend.

In the previous part, the frontend could ask for the list of notes from the json-server we had as a backend, from the address <http://localhost:3001/notes>.
Our backend has a slightly different URL structure now, as the notes can be found at <http://localhost:3001/api/notes>. Let's change the attribute **baseUrl** in the <i>src/services/notes.js</i> like so:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3001/api/notes'; //highlight-line

const getAll = () => {
  const request = axios.get(baseUrl);
  return request.then((response) => response.data);
};

// ...

export default { getAll, create, update };
```

Now frontend's GET request to <http://localhost:3001/api/notes> does not work for some reason:

![Get request showing error in dev tools](https://fullstackopen.com/static/da88e17cb078c89a6e7ba30d61fab0e6/5a190/3ae.png)

What's going on here? We can access the backend from a browser and from postman without any problems.

### Same origin policy and CORS

The issue lies with a thing called _same origin policy_. A URL's origin is defined by the combination of protocol (AKA scheme), hostname, and port.

```text
http://example.com:80/index.html

protocol: http
host: example.com
port: 80
```

When you visit a website (i.e <http://catwebsites.com>), the browser issues a request to the server on which the website (catwebsites.com) is hosted. The response sent by the server is an HTML file that may contain one or more references to external assets/resources hosted either on the same server that <i>catwebsites.com</i> is hosted on or a different website. When the browser sees reference(s) to a URL in the source HTML, it issues a request. If the request is issued using the URL that the source HTML was fetched from, then the browser processes the response without any issues. However, if the resource is fetched using a URL that doesn't share the same origin(scheme, host, port) as the source HTML, the browser will have to check the _Access-Control-Allow-origin_ response header. If it contains _\*_ or the URL of the source HTML, the browser will process the response, otherwise the browser will refuse to process it and throw an error.

The <strong>same-origin policy</strong> is a security mechanism implemented by browsers in order to prevent session hijacking among other security vulnerabilities.

In order to enable legitimate cross-origin requests (requests to URLs that don't share the same origin) W3C came up with a mechanism called <strong>CORS</strong>(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing):

> <i>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.</i>

The problem is that, by default, the JavaScript code of an application that runs in a browser can only communicate with a server in the same [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).
Because our server is in localhost port 3001, while our frontend is in localhost port 3000, they do not have the same origin.

Keep in mind, that [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) and CORS are not specific to React or Node. They are universal principles regarding the safe operation of web applications.

We can allow requests from other <i>origins</i> by using Node's [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) middleware.

In your backend repository, install <i>cors</i> with the command

```bash
npm install cors
```

take the middleware to use and allow for requests from all origins:

```js
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors());
```

And the frontend works! However, the functionality for changing the importance of notes has not yet been implemented on the backend.

You can read more about CORS from [Mozilla's page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

The setup of our app looks now as follows:

![diagram of react app and browser](https://fullstackopen.com/static/2aa09f5e7969cf4ec229aceb70abfa26/664c8/100.png)

The react app running in the browser now fetches the data from node/express-server that runs in localhost:3001.

### Application to the Internet

The developer-friendly services like PaaS (i.e. Platform as a Service) take care of installing the execution environment (eg. Node.js) and could also provide various services such as databases.

Heroku, fly.io, render,

[Heroku](http://heroku.com)

[Fly.io](https://fly.io/) and [Render](https://render.com/)

Some course participants have also used the following

- [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com)
- [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io)

For both Fly.io and Render, we need to change the definition of the port our application uses at the bottom of the <i>index.js</i> file like so:

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001; // highlight-line
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Now we are using the port defined in the [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) _PORT_ or port 3001 if the environment variable _PORT_ is undefined. Fly.io and Render configure the application port based on that environment variable.

###Render
[sign in](https://dashboard.render.com/), through github

create a new "web service" / might need connecting to Github

The app repository is then connected to Render (only public Repo?)

If the app is not at the root of the repository the Root directory needs to be given a proper value. install: npm install / start: npm start

According to the documentation every commit to GitHub should redeploy the app. For some reason this is not always working. Fortunately it is also possible to manually redeploy the app.

Also the app logs can be seen in the dashboard. We notice now from the logs that the app has been started in the port 10000. The app code gets the right port through the environment variable PORT so it is essential that the file index.js has been updated as mentioned above.

### Frontend production build

In development mode the application is configured to give clear error messages, immediately render code changes to the browser, and so on.

When the application is deployed, we must create a [production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) or a version of the application which is optimized for production.

A production build of applications created with <i>create-react-app</i> can be created with the command [npm run build](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#npm-run-build-or-yarn-build).

This creates a directory called <i>build</i> (which contains the only HTML file of our application, <i>index.html</i> ) which contains the directory <i>static</i>. [Minified](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)>) version of our application's JavaScript code will be generated in the <i>static</i> directory. Even though the application code is in multiple files, all of the JavaScript will be minified into one file. All of the code from all of the application's dependencies will also be minified into this single file. The minified code is not very readable.

### Serving static files from the backend

One option for deploying the frontend is to copy the production build (the <i>build</i> directory) to the root of the backend repository and configure the backend to show the frontend's <i>main page</i> (the file <i>build/index.html</i>) as its main page.

We begin by copying the production build of the frontend to the root of the backend.

If you are using a Windows computer, you may use either [copy](https://www.windows-commandline.com/windows-copy-command-syntax-examples/) or [xcopy](https://www.windows-commandline.com/xcopy-command-syntax-examples/) command instead. Otherwise, simply copy and paste.

To make express show <i>static content</i>, the page <i>index.html</i> and the JavaScript, etc., it fetches, we need a built-in middleware from express called [static](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html).

When we add the following amidst the declarations of middlewares

```js
app.use(express.static('build'));
```

whenever express gets an HTTP GET request it will first check if the <i>build</i> directory contains a file corresponding to the request's address. If a correct file is found, express will return it.

Now HTTP GET requests to the address <i>www.serversaddress.com/index.html</i> or <i>www.serversaddress.com</i> will show the React frontend. GET requests to the address <i>www.serversaddress.com/api/notes</i> will be handled by the backend's code.

Because of our situation, both the frontend and the backend are at the same address, we can declare _baseUrl_ as a [relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970917/htmlweb.html#h-5.1.2) URL. This means we can leave out the part declaring the server.

```js
import axios from 'axios';
const baseUrl = '/api/notes'; // highlight-line

const getAll = () => {
  const request = axios.get(baseUrl);
  return request.then((response) => response.data);
};

// ...
```

After the change, we have to create a new production build of the frontend and copy it to the root of the backend repository.

The application can now be used from the <i>backend</i> address <http://localhost:3001>:

Our application now works exactly like the [single-page app](/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#single-page-app) example application we studied in part 0.

When we use a browser to go to the address <http://localhost:3001>, the server returns the <i>index.html</i> file from the <i>build</i> repository. The summarized contents of the file are as follows:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>
  <title>React App</title>
  <link href="/static/css/main.f9a47af2.chunk.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="/static/js/1.578f4ea1.chunk.js"></script>
  <script src="/static/js/main.104ca08d.chunk.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The file contains instructions to fetch a CSS stylesheet defining the styles of the application, and two <i>script</i> tags that instruct the browser to fetch the JavaScript code of the application - the actual React application.

The React code fetches notes from the server address <http://localhost:3001/api/notes> and renders them to the screen. The communications between the server and the browser can be seen in the <i>Network</i> tab of the developer console:

The setup that is ready for a product deployment looks as follows:

![diagram of deployment ready react app](https://fullstackopen.com/static/6f33425b60b49278d57df7e62f81a32c/db910/101.png)

Unlike when running the app in a development environment, everything is now in the same node/express-backend that runs in localhost:3001. When the browser goes to the page, the file <i>index.html</i> is rendered. That causes the browser to fetch the production version of the React app. Once it starts to run, it fetches the json-data from the address localhost:3001/api/notes.

### The whole app to the internet

After ensuring that the production version of the application works locally, commit the production build of the frontend to the backend repository, and push the code to GitHub again.

If you are using Render a push to GitHub <i>might</i> be enough. If the automatic deployment does not work, select the "manual deploy" from the Render dashboard.

The setup looks like now as follows:

![diagram of react app on heroku with a database](https://fullstackopen.com/static/26dbec11959a8d1418e81b31e11624d0/5a190/102.png)

The node/express-backend now resides in the Fly.io/Render server. When the root address is accessed, the browser loads and executes the React app that fetches the json-data from the Fly.io/Render server.

### Streamlining deploying of the frontend

To create a new production build of the frontend without extra manual work, let's add some npm-scripts to the <i>package.json</i> of the backend repository.

#### Render

Note: When you attempt to deploy your backend to Render, make sure you have a separate repository for the backend and deploy that github repo through Render, attempting to deploy through your Fullstackopen repository will often throw "ERR path ....package.json".

In case of Render, the scripts look like the following

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    //...
    "build:ui": "rm -rf build && cd ../frontend && npm run build && cp -r build ../backend",
    "deploy:full": "npm run build:ui && git add . && git commit -m uibuild && git push"
  }
}
```

The script _npm run build:ui_ builds the frontend and copies the production version under the backend repository. _npm run deploy:full_ contains also the necessary <i>git</i> commands to update the backend repository.

Note that the directory paths in the script <i>build:ui</i> depend on the location of repositories in the file system.

> **NB** On Windows, npm scripts are executed in cmd.exe as the default shell which does not support bash commands. For the above bash commands to work, you can change the default shell to Bash (in the default Git for Windows installation) as follows:

```md
npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"
```

Another option is the use of [shx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shx).

### Proxy

Changes on the frontend have caused it to no longer work in development mode (when started with command _npm start_), as the connection to the backend does not work.

![Network dev tools showing a 404 on getting notes](https://fullstackopen.com/static/c2dc22eab2be6e45278c02055c079123/5a190/32new.png)

This is due to changing the backend address to a relative URL:

```js
const baseUrl = '/api/notes';
```

Because in development mode the frontend is at the address <i>localhost:3000</i>, the requests to the backend go to the wrong address <i>localhost:3000/api/notes</i>. The backend is at <i>localhost:3001</i>.

If the project was created with create-react-app, this problem is easy to solve. It is enough to add the following declaration to the <i>package.json</i> file of the frontend repository.

```bash
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
  },
  "scripts": {
    // ...
  },
  "proxy": "http://localhost:3001"  // highlight-line
}
```

After a restart, the React development environment will work as a [proxy](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/). If the React code does an HTTP request to a server address at <i><http://localhost:3000></i> not managed by the React application itself (i.e. when requests are not about fetching the CSS or JavaScript of the application), the request will be redirected to the server at <i><http://localhost:3001></i>.

Now the frontend is also fine, working with the server both in development- and production mode.

A negative aspect of our approach is how complicated it is to deploy the frontend. Deploying a new version requires generating a new production build of the frontend and copying it to the backend repository. This makes creating an automated [deployment pipeline](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html) more difficult. Deployment pipeline means an automated and controlled way to move the code from the computer of the developer through different tests and quality checks to the production environment. Building a deployment pipeline is the topic of [part 11](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11) of this course.

There are multiple ways to achieve this (for example placing both backend and frontend code [in the same repository](https://github.com/mars/heroku-cra-node) ) but we will not go into those now.

In some situations, it may be sensible to deploy the frontend code as its own application. With apps created with create-react-app it is [straightforward](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).

The current backend code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part3-notes-backend/tree/part3-3), in the branch <i>part3-3</i>. The changes in frontend code are in <i>part3-1</i> branch of the [frontend repository](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part2-notes/tree/part3-1).

> In the phonebook excercise in part 2, the route _'/persons'_ is assigned to the baseUrl variable, however here, in part 3, we have used the route _'/api/persons'_ to access the backend data through axios. This change will break the frontend once we run it locally with json-server. To overcome this problem, after using the proxy, the following route.json file must be added to the frontend root to redirect request to "/api/persons" to "/persons" path:

_routes.json_ includes:

```js
{
  "/api/persons": "/persons"
}

```

Updated json-server json run command:

```bash
json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json --routes routes.json
```
